## Snek

This is a fully-functioning clone of the classic snake game we have all come to enjoy.

This project was used to familiarize myself with React state management and to test various UI layouts, as well as their compability with multi-display rendering.

It was built using the ReactJS framework and the production is hosted on https://hardcore-hermann-574aa9.netlify.com/
